# Top 10 List of Week 02

Straight to the point, let's get started with it.

### 1. [Top 10 Biggest Data Breaches in 2018](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-breaches-in-2018/)
As my preference goes to GeeksforGeeks, the article that I found here may be a little bit outdated as it was written in 2018. But what makes it interesting is that it is my first article from my first GSGS. It basically tells about the tale of how big companies are breached.

### 2. [Security](https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html)
Not going to lie, this is basically a short version of OSC textbooks, and I must include it as how dense and informative it is, and not with too many styling in the website, just plain simple. The website is covering all what is written on OSC books chapter 15 about security in OS.

### 3. [Operating System - Security](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_security.htm)
This is also another good reference apart from GeeksforGeeks. For this case, I include it because it includes the information about computer security classifications, something that I haven't study yet in my reading session of OSC chapter 15.

### 4. [What is Cryptography : Types, Tools and Its Algorithms](https://www.elprocus.com/cryptography-and-its-concepts/)
Now this is basically the link that I found after learning a bit about cryptography from link no. 2 and it is neat, to be honest. The article talks about what is cryptography, its types, and its tools. It also mentioned the implementation of the cryptography.

### 5. [Defence in Depth Security Model](https://www.cyberteamsecurity.com/defence-depth-security-model.html)
This website is talking about the depth security model. The first layer is the network, the second layer is the host, the third layer is the application, the fourth layer is the data. Each of it has its own security, the point of the layer is to anticipate full breach.

### 6. [Operating System Questions & Answers â€“ Protection Concepts](https://www.sanfoundry.com/operating-system-questions-answers-protection-concepts/)
A website that is full with useful information is good, but a website that is full with useful information and then to put it to the test is great. For learning about operating systems protection, it uses quiz as the way to learn, so that I can check whether my knowledge regarding it is correct or not.

### 7. [Access Matrix in Operating System/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-matrix-in-operating-system/)
As it was made for an amazing search engine optimization, this website is easy to search and decent on its reliability of infomration in it. Furhtermore, it is simple and clean at explaining the concept of access matrix in OS.

### 8. [Access Control](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/419/notes/access.html)
I shoud give a shoutout to Paul Krzyzanowski for his deliberate explanation on the topic of access contol of OS. He explained well regarding the memory management unit, kernel mode, acess and sharing files, etc. Not to mention the example on the usage of terminal regarding the topic.

### 9. [On Security in Capability-Based Systems](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~trj1/cse544-s13/docs/gong_cap_osr.pdf)
A short artice about the security in capability-based systems by Li Gong from University of Cambridge. In the paper, Gong mentioned about the weakness in classic capability systems, fully armed systems, stand-alone systems, and networked systems.

### 10. [A Case for Language-Based Protection](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/slk/papers/TR98-1670.pdf)
For the last part, I think I want to include this paper as it is basically telling about the case for language-based protection. It mentioned about the (stereo-)typical advantages of language-based mechanisms, like precision, rights amplication, etc. It also mentioned about the (stereo-)typical probelms with it, such as TCB complexity,  garbage collection, etc.

Okay, I'm done.

Qapla! Jolan Tru!
