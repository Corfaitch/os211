# Top 3 Tips for Facing os212

Straight to the point, let's go.

### 1. Always follow the osp4diss procedure
osp4diss is a website for a profoundly just-follow-it instruction regarding the os212 resources. So, do exactly what it told. Yeah, exactly.

### 2. Do task early
There is always an unexpected time, even when I did it early, I still can't manage to fulfill some task due to my computer performance. So, you need to do the task earlier.

### 3. Always backup
Emphasis on anticipating failure, you can use a big HDD to back up file that you might need in case you are failing on something. It is quite useful, to be honest.

Okay, I think I am done.

Qapla! Jolan Tru!
