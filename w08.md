# Top 10 List of Week 08

Straight to the point, let's get down to the business.

### 1. [What is meant by CPU Burst and I/O Burst?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-CPU-Burst-and-I-O-Burst)
For those who are still new to the terms of OS, people will refer to Quora for answers. I checked the answers in questions, especially with what I linked above. I have to say that the answer is easy to understand and often in a premium answer, like you get something from a reliable source such as Silberschatz’s book. It is basically, you guess it, to ask what is CPU burst and I/O burst. It is similar when the program “runs” until it can’t anymore.

### 2. [CPU Schedulers](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/cpu-schedulers-schedulers-in-os-schedulers/)
Now, this is the first time I get a website for OS top 10 from Gate Vidyalay, like this is the first time I encounter this website and I believe it is kinda popular if I searched it more thoroughly. As for the content, it talks about what a CPU scheduler is. The article said that the scheduler is special system software as it decides which software to run first. The rest is explaining in detail what it is.

### 3. [Dispatcher in Operating System | Dispatcher vs Scheduler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SydpWAOzmuE)
For the dispatcher, I have to say that I don’t know anything about dispatcher until I read the OSC book. When I read it a bit, it says that dispatcher is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the scheduler. When I watched this video. It explained how it is kinda similar to the book such as how scheduler is more focused on managing the program, and how dispatcher is always on context-switching.

### 4. [What is the scheduling criteria in an operating system?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scheduling-criteria-in-an-operating-system)
Talking about Quora in this top 10, I usually include only 1 page from this website, and it is based on a Google search. Somehow, I also found another page of Quora that discusses scheduling criteria. Plus, I actually want to be creative in my search, but I found not just an answer, but a resource that I stumbled upon but never used in this top 10. In short, this Quora question answered with something like 5 things to consider, like turnaround time, throughput, waiting time, etc.

### 5. [Process scheduling algorithms in the Operating System](https://afteracademy.com/blog/process-scheduling-algorithms-in-the-operating-system)
Making use of the Google search engine, and continuing the keyword that I can find on OSC book, the next top 10 is basically more about the same usual article that you can find using both of it. Pretty much, this is material that you can find on the OSC book. It discusses some algorithms mentioned in the book such as First Come First Serve algorithm,  Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling, etc.

### 6. [Thread scheduling](https://padakuu.com/article/100-thread-scheduling)
This is kind of a cheap one to find, you just search for the term “Thread Scheduling” on Google, and you click whatever you find the most comfortable with. In this case, I found Padakuu website from the result of the search and what I find is, a comprehensive article regarding thread scheduling. It is almost full text with some illustration. For those who like to read, it is a good website, espeically when the content is categorized well.

### 7. [Multiprocessor Scheduling in Operating System](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/multiprocessor-scheduling-in-operating-system.aspx)
I’m surprised to find a niche enough website that comes to the first page of my search on Google. In fact, this is the first time I found the name of this website: Include Help. Although the website might be different to what I see on OSC, this website is something that I consider comprehensive. It talks how each CPU has its own OS, the master slave multiprocessor, symmetric multiprocessor, etc.

### 8. [CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)
Now this is kinda repetitive, but I found another website that I found more fun to read and more contextualized with bullet points so you can understand better. Also, this is the website that I found during my Google search around a few top 10s ago. Guru99 can make something that makes it digestable to the brain, so I must include this one. it basically the same with no. 5 but with more comprehensive information.

### 9. [Five Common Operating Systems](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/five-common-operating-systems-28217.html)
Now, I want to step back from the detailed explanation and come to the most basic article I can find regarding OS, this is basically like doing w00 all over again, but since I searched for the keyword “Operating System Examples'' on Google, I found many to this. Basically, it is just listing the most popular OS that people use everyday. Such as Windows, Androis OS, and Linux.

### 10. [Algorithm Evaluation](http://www.faadooengineers.com/online-study/post/cse/operating-system/256/algorithm-evaluation)
Lastly, I want to come back to a well-explained data that I can find on Google, this time, I looked for the most optimized page, like the most relatable search for my Google search, which is “Algorithm Evaluation in OS”. A term that I found in OSC book for the several times. This is an article that discuss algorithm evaluation and some measurements to do it such as for maximizing CPU utilization and maximizing through put.

Okay, I’m done.

Qapla! Jolan Tru!
