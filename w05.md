# Top 10 List of Week 05

Straight to the point, let's get started with it.

### 1. [What is Virtual Memory? What Does it Do?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeOBEOBJREs)
Now if we want to talk how to apporach the OS topic regarding virtual memory properly, this is the video that is like making the OSC book with the topic about this into a short and quick explanation about what it is. It might not cover the whole book, but it is a good start to talk about the video. The video explains about what is virtual memory, a memory that is using disk memory in case the physical memory is in shortage.

### 2. [Virtual Memory](https://teachcomputerscience.com/virtual-memory/)
This website covers about virtual memory. Unlike the video above, this one is more comprehensive. Equiped with the table of contents, the website talks a lot about what it is, what is characteristics, and the advantage of virtual memory and also its disadvantage. It also talks about demand paging and the disadvantage of it. I would recommend to use this website in case OSC is still enough.

### 3. [What is Virtual Memory?](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/virtual-memory)
For this one, I actually went to search for the best article for what is demand paging. Instead, I found another similar website regarding virtual memory in general. Sure, it has similar thing that is mentioned in the list above, so I just write interesting thing that I found here. Since, I look for the demand paging part, and the explanation is quite simple. Like there is a term for pure demang paging, etc.

### 4. [Copy on Wtire in Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3hPGyd8vwk)
Another video that I found, and it was brought by an Indian woman, which is kinda nice. Now, finally I can find a talk that is more specific and more detailed about copy on write, or COW for short. In this video, the woman talked about what is COW, it is defined as initial bypass of the need for demand paging by using a technique similar to page sharing.

### 5. [What are Page Replacement Algorithms?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XMVk5YA7vA)
Again, I use video, since I compare to some resources, but it was already mentioning the previous article and I don't want to repeat myself. So, in the article. It is mentioned that in a computer operating system, page replacement is an algorithm that decide which memory pages to page out, soemtimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated. The video also mentioned about page fault, an interrupt raised bu the hardware when a running program access a memory page that is mapped into the virtual address space, but not loaded in physical memory.

### 6. [Allocation of Frames](https://padakuu.com/article/72-allocation-of-frames)
This website is something that I found if I don't want to be lazy and mentioning GFG or Javatpoints, like this is another reliable source of information, this time I went to search about allocation of frames in OS and found this. Not going to lie, the information is quite beneficial and kind of structured. The webiste mentioned about what it is, and also mentioning about number of frames. Like the minimum of it. There is also an allocation algorithms that I found interesting as well, although it is not written exactly what it is, only the idea of it.

### 7. [Thrashing in Operating System](https://www.computersciencejunction.in/2018/07/09/thrashing-in-os-html/)
Another website that I found to be decent with content, equipped with outline of what will the reader read. Now there are a handful number of outline, like what is trashing, the cause of it in OS, and how to overcome it. It is also mention about working set model, like what it is, and how does it work. It also mentioned about degree of multi-programming and locality of reference.

### 8. [On Memory Mapped Files](https://ayende.com/blog/162791/on-memory-mapped-files)
This website is actually started with a man nambed Tobi had a few question about memory mapped files. The writer felt like it was an interesting topic, so the writer wrote it. In the writing, it mentioned about what it is, it is basically, a feature for all modern operating system. It require coordination between the memory manager and the I/O subsytem. Oh yeah, the forum is also quite nice to see if there are some discussion going on.

### 9. [Allocating Kernel Memory in Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKWSk0o-TxE)
Now, to be honest, I tried to find the most niche content out there, and I found this from the filter of my selection. For the 4th time, I use video as I got to admit, this is the most niche content that I can find. Now, for this, I would like to see the video. But for this, I would like to give yourself a look. Basically, it mentioned about buddy system memory allocation and slab allocation.

### 10. [How is Virtual Memory Translated to Physical Memory?](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/03/how-is-virtual-memory-translated-to-physical-memory.html)
At last, I decided to see for other things like prepaging or TLB reach, according to OSC. But what I found is this from my Google search. So, a virtual memory translated to physical memory. And to describe it, is use Memory Management Unit and Translation Lookaside Buffer to map the virtual memory addresses to the physical memory layer.

Okay, I think I am done.

Qapla! Jolan Tru!
