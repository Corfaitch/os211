# Top 10 List of Week 07

Straight to the point, let's get down to the business.

### 1. [Chapter 5: Critical Section Problem
](https://github.com/omarsar/os/blob/master/5.%20Critical%20Section%20Problem.md)
Now, since the demand is we need to be more creative doing this, so I make a profoundly niche search in Google. Basically, searching about a topic in OSC and then clicking page more than 2. Then, I found this Github .md commit that talks about Critical Section Problem, the sub topic of synchronization topic of OSC. The article then explained about the notes of that topic. Such as the requirements for critical section, progress criteria. etc.

### 2. [Which Peterson’s Solution is right?](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/98807/which-peterson-s-solution-is-right)
For the second one, I would like to introduce a question from someone regarding which Peterson’s Solution is right. He/she refers to the mutual exclusion of the Peterson’s solution. There are two things that is mentioned in the question. One of it comes from the book title “Modern Operating Systems” while the other one refers to the book titled “Operating System Concepts”. In short, both are correct.

### 3. [Peterson's Solution](https://scanftree.com/operating-system/peterson-solution)
Another reference that I got regarding Peterson’s Solution is this one, I believe the name of the website is niche and can be considered as something more creative in searching. Now, regarding to the material, it basically talks about processes to enter into critical section.

### 4. [Synchronization Hardware](https://basicittopic.com/synchronization-hardware/)
Another website that I found to be niche, and the article is basically talking about synchronization hardware. Basically, it talks about the hardware instructions that are availabe on many systems and how it can be used to solve critical section problem.

### 5. [Mutex in Operating system (OS)](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/mutex/)
This website, like its name, is to make a preparation for further study. Also, I want to emphasize on how simple and short the explanation is. So that I can use it to understand the subject better. The article is basically talking about Mutual Exclusion Locks or Mutex locks, a variable that is binary nature that provides code wise functionality for mutual exclusion.

### 6. [Classical Problems of Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/classical-problems-of-synchronization) 
I saw this website before for the previous top 10. So, I want to use it again as my current top 10 regarding this topic for how it is written. There is an introduction and what we should do next to learn about it. The article is mainly talking about 3 problems of three following problems: Bounded Buffer Problem, Dining Philosophers Problem, and The Readers Writers Problem.

### 7. [Semaphore](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/semaphore)
For this, I would like to attribute this website for explaining things in a dense and short way. In which I want to learn more about semaphores in OS. In short, semaphore in OS means a technique for coordinating or synchronizing activities in which multiple processes compete for the same operating system resources

### 8. [DEADLOCK PREVENTION, AVOIDANCE, DETECTION AND RECOVERY IN OPERATING SYSTEMS](https://javajee.com/deadlock-prevention-avoidance-detection-and-recovery-in-operating-systems)
Now, I have to seek for the most niche content about deadlock, and to be honest, I was just looking for the basic understanding on the characteristics of deadlock characterization. Turns out, I found more than that. And to make things better, it is more comprehensive than any other material that I can find. The article is mainly talking about deadlocks and its variation of topics, such as prevention of ti, avoidance, detection, and recovery. Although I haven’t find the characteristic of it in the article. This is much better than I thought.

### 9. [Deadlock Characterization Part 1 | Necessary Conditions for Deadlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23xp51q2LP0)
This is now about a YouTube video, because like 90% of the top 10 that I give are about articles. I think it's time to make a variation of it with a video. As usual, this was brought to you  by an Indian man. The video is about what is the characterization of deadlock, it consist of 4 necessary conditions, such as mutual exclusion,  hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait.

### 10. [Deadlock and Method for Handling Deadlock](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/deadlock-and-method-for-handling-deadlock.aspx)
Finally, this is the one that made me excited, as I found many things regarding deadlock and how to handle many cases of it. The article is now basically talking about how to handle deadlocks. There are 4 methods of handling deadlocks, such as deadlock ignorance, deadlock prevention, deadlock avoidance, and deadlock detection and recovery.

Okay, I think I am done.

Qapla! Jolan Tru!
