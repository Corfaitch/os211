# Top 10 List of Week 01

Straight to the point, let's get started with it.

### 1. [File Operations in Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZNEh4hBlYM)
For starter, if you are quite long in the IT world, you'll realize that often people from India are the ones who make the most searchable tutorial video in the world, like they always come on top on Google search when looking for IT stuff tutorial such as programming and OS developing. This one is no different, but I take this video because it is simple and to the point when talking about file operations such as creating a file, writign a file, reading a file, etc.

### 2. [Access Method](https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Access_Method)
To make an argument, this website is interesting because it referenced into many sources of writing for the article. For example, if you look carefully, you'll see the exact copy of a reference to another while also citing where the writer got it. Which, is pretty respectable. The content itself is explaining about the definition of access method, types of it, purpose of it, etc.

### 3. [Directory Structure](https://binaryterms.com/directory-structure-in-os.html)
Apart from this and another website that I found, I chose this as another one became out of the scope of OS. So, I found this and to be honest, this is quite spot-on with the mentioning many aspect of directory structure, which is a part of the subject discussed in the Chapter 13 of OSC. Like, single-level directory, two-level directory structure, hierarchical directory structure, etc. It also mentioned more than that like tree directory structure and acyclic-graph directory structure.

### 4. [Linux Mounting and Unmounting a Filesystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fik4AVZGr1I)
This video is suppose for getting the Google IT Support Professional Certificate. Interestingly, in this video we learned on how using the mount command and umount command in order to mount and unmount the command. This is doable if we have a flashdisk to plug or something similar. We also learned to get the ID of it and to connect it to the computer as the part of disk management.

### 5. [4 Ways to Transfer Files and Directories on Linux](https://devconnected.com/4-ways-to-transfer-files-and-directories-on-linux/)
I was also going to choose whether to include this website or another, but another website is not suitable for my taste as it covers in a basic way and not comprehensive, so I chose this. The article of this websites talks about on how to transfer files and directories using a way like using ftp, then it proceed to the variation of it such as downloading files and uploading files on Linux using ftp.

### 6. [Linux Directory Structure (File System Structure) Explained with Examples](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure/)
So, an article with dense explanation is good, but an article with example is great. With that, I chose this website. Now, for starter, it talked about why there is /bin or /sbin or /usr/bin etc. It also explaining about the meaning of individual high-level directories. And then the explanation behind every directories, like what is root, what is bin, what is etc.

### 7. [File System Implementation](https://gcallah.github.io/OperatingSystems/FileImplementation.html)
Now, I might be biased, but I should mention that when it comes to anything to github.io website, especially a personal one, it is usually good. So far, this one is the example. Simple design, no ads, just plain information presented well. To talk about what this website here, it talked about making a file system, such learning about file-system layout, implementing directories, and log-structured file systems.

### 8. [Explain File Allocation Methods in Detail with Proper Diagram](https://www.ques10.com/p/25214/explain-file-allocation-methods-in-detail-with-pro/)
I'm going to be honest, this is not a kind of website that I like, like I am expecting a neater UI for it. But, at least the name Ques10 is quite unique. I chose this website because most of it are GFG or Javatpoints, so I took the niche one. The website content itself, on the other hand, has a good explanation such as using picture for the illustration. It explained the type of file allocation such as indexed allocation, contiguous allocation, and linked location.

### 9. [Free Space Management in Operating System - CodeTextPro](https://www.codetextpro.com/2019/10/free-space-management-in-os.html)
To make it more niche, my website search that is based on Google is now using more less frequent website that have less SEO exposure. So, I got this website. Surprisingly, this one needs more traffic as it deserves more with yet another simple design. Basically, the website is explaining about some techniques of free space management, such as bit vector, linked free space list, or indexed block list.

### 10. [What is the WAFL File System?](https://padakuu.com/article/148-what-is-the-wafl-file-system)
Finally, a Padakuu website. A website that is also covering about OS. In this link, Padakuu team is writing about WAFL (Write Anywhere File Layout), and it sounds like waffle. In short, this website deliberately talking about the example of WAFL and the benefits of it. It also talked about how WAFL is ease to use, as it is one of the guiding principle of WAFL.

Okay, I'm done.

Qapla! Jolan Tru!

P.S: I don't include GFG or Javatpoints for this week because it is highly optimized for search engine and I believe everybody wants to use that website as a reference.
