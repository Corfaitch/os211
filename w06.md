# Top 10 List of Week 06

Straight to the point, let's get down to the business.

### 1. [States of a Process in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/states-of-a-process-in-operating-systems/)
I’m going to be honest, for once I want to use the Geeks for Geeks reference as it is easy to find, and you’re right I want to use something that is easy because I am kinda in a rush to finish this so I need to use a well-known website to learn. In short, this was something reminiscent of a class lecture that I have about the state process, there is a create section, ready section. run section, blocked section, etc.

### 2. [Process Scheduling: Long, Medium, Short Term Scheduler](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html)
Now for this one, I remember using this website for the previous weekly top 10, and now I am thinking I must be using the same popular website to make the best version of the top 10, and I said, oh well. I can manage to find a niche one later. The website is mainly talking about the process scheduling queues, two state process models, scheduling objective, type of process schedulers, long term schedulers, etc.

### 3. [Operations on Process in OS - System Calls](https://www.krivalar.com/OS-operations-on-process)
Oh look, I found out why there is “may the fork() be with you” reference, it’s perhaps because we are learning about fork() here on this website. I mean, we can learn from the book of OSC, but I learned the origin of it on this website. To simply put it, this is kinda similar to Stat of Process diagram, but this is talking about process cycle using system calls. Alongside with fork() we also got the term such as wait(), exec(), and exit().

### 4. [What is Interprocess Communication?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-interprocess-communication)
Another popular website apart from Geeks for Geeks that also hit things by the storm. Sometimes I want to know why my searches found these websites. Perhaps it is SEO. So, perhaps I want to learn more about SEO in the future. Btw, sidetracked a bit, so let me explain a bit about this website. It is telling us about the interprocess communication of operating system, like talking of the synchronization of it and the approaches of it, 

### 5. [Communication In Client-Server Systems | Sockets | Remote Procedure Calls| RPC | Pipes|| OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOrmV3NcBKU)

To make things more fun, I use a video to learn more about communication in client-server system, and as usual, mostly you’ll find people from India to make it. So, kudos again for the several times to them. In this case, it is Sudhakar Atchala. Now for the topic, it is talking about communication in client-server system using sockets, on how they communicate with each other. There is also a term to be learn like sockets and pipes in the context of operating systems.

### 6. [What is multicore programming?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-multicore-programming)
Now, Quora usually gives me premium quality answer, but I have to put my understanding well regarding this. Now, when I saw this on my search, I was thinking how was the answer? Asnwer: decent. So I think why don’t I put it to the list? I rarely use Quora website for top 10. Anyway, the point of the answer is that it is similar to multi-thread or shared memory programming. It also mentioned that is useful tp utilize the large number of cores within the machine (processor).

### 7. [Multithreading Models in Operating System](https://binaryterms.com/multithreading-models-in-operating-system.html)
I remember using binary terms for previous top 10, it is a good website that covers the lesson pretty neat. I mean, after all, it is to search for a term related to computer science, like in OS. So, this website is good for that. To seek for the core of the material written. It is more about mapping the user threads to the kernel threads. It explain what it is, and cover many types of it such as many to one or one to many or many to many models.

### 8. [Thread Libraries](https://padakuu.com/article/101-thread-libraries)
And I also used padakuu before in the previous top 10, and for the sake of comprehensiveness, I use it. Firstly it talks about what it thread libraries as a source of API for creating and managing threads It also talks about ways to implement it. It also talks about most common libraries that is used today: POSIX Pthreads, Win32, and Java. Pthreads.

### 9. [Implicit Threading and Language-based threads](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/implicit-threading-and-language-based-threads)
Now for this, I found another Tutorials Point website as a good resource, but for this time due to how difficult it is to find a website that talks about the same topic, which is Implicit Threading, this website should be reused with different topic. Now, I also wonder what it is, and to be fair, it discuss about the implicti threading as usage of libraries or other language support to hide the management of threads. The most common implicit threading library is OpenMP, in context of C. It also talked about Grand Central Dispatch of it.

### 10. [What is POSIX? Richard Stallman explains](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/what-posix-richard-stallman-explains)
Now, I mentioned about POSIX in one of my top 10 list in here, so I want to touch that subject but with more spicific topic. So, this article is brought to you by Richard Stallman in opesource.com, in which I see it as a website about free learning of computer science topic. Anyway, Stallman said in the article that "open" and "closed" are the wrong way to classify software. Stallman classifies programs as freedom-respecting ("free" or "libre") and freedom-trampling ("non-free" or "proprietary"). The rest is about the interview with a guy named Seth and Stallman himself regarding POSIX. Worth to check if you watn to see it.

Okay, I’m done.

Qapla! Jolan Tru!
