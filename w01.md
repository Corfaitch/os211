# Top 10 List of Week 01

Straight to the point, let's get started with it.

### 1. [Functions of Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functions-of-operating-system/)
This is the first thing that I searched to answer the overview question, and since I remembered about Geeks for Geeks Website, I decided to choose this link. It's simple, dense, and straight to the point. It basically says the purpose of OS like program execution, and file management.

### 2. [Discuss Operating System Design Issues](https://www.ques10.com/p/25212/discuss-operating-system-design-issues/)
This website is helpful to know clearly about the problem of the OS design. In short, it talks about the problem to make it high in perfomance, the problem to make it reliable, etc. Kind of hard to find the website that isn't paid regarding this question.

### 3. [What is an API?](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api)
MuleSoft is not known to make a learning resources, yet they did it. In short, they explain that in analogy of a restaurant, API is like the waiter that connects the customer and the cook. Also, this is the first link that appears in my Google search.

### 4. [Operating System Organization Purpose of an OS](http://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/courses/cps312/lectures/pdf/OS_organization.pdf)
At first, I was looking for a simple Google search regarding the device organization of OS. This link helps it. Surprisingly, it was also how it is discussing the design issue of the OS and how it is connected to OS organization. Something cool.

### 5. [User Mode vs Kernel Mode](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/User-Mode-vs-Kernel-Mode)
TutorialsPoint might not be my favorite resource for learning OS or other related courses, but I found this one simply enough to be inserted to top 10. The article is explaining about how what is user mode and kernel mode and how to switch between those two modes.

### 6. [Virtualization for Newbies: Five Types of Virtualization](https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/resources/resource-library/articles/virtualization-for-newbies-five-types-of-virtualization/)
First of all, this link is pretty comprehensive when talking about the types of virtualization, like it is a comprehensive manual for a complex machine. Now I learned about five types of virtualization: dekstop, application, server, storage, and network virtualization. Makes me wonder are we going to learn all of it.

### 7. [Virtual Memory: Paging](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/courses/comp530/f18/slides/paging.pdf)
From the University of North Carolina, comes a document of presentation slides of paging. At first, I was thinking this is the continuation of Introduction of Computer Organization course at Universitas Indonesia. It talks about physical addressing and virtual addressing of the computer and the example of how to doit.

### 8. [Emulation or Virtualization?](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2551154/emulation-or-virtualization-.html) 
I was a little bit considering both of emulation and virualization are the same in some way. This article sheds some light about it. Surprisingly, it was written on June 22, 2009. Old, but gold. Emulation is about imitating one system in a hardware it was supposed not to be, like Windows in a Mac. Virtualization is about taking part of the hardware capabilities to be used for a system to run.

### 9. [Hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor)
This page has a glossary of VM world, one of it is hypervisor, the one that we use in this top 10 right now. Turns out, the article has many level of understading considering how it was written. There is a simple explanation that hypervisor is the monitor of VM, and then the type of hypervisors is written there.

### 10. [Linux Regular Expression Tutorial: Grep Regex Example](https://www.guru99.com/linux-regular-expressions.html)
I'm going to be honest, this website is not my preference when it comes to resources, but at least the website has some links regarding using regex. One of it is grep regex, the one to search the attribute of a file. I learned about some basic regex and how to implement it with a pictured example. So, I guess that makes it to the top 10.

Okay, I'm done.

Qapla! Jolan Tru!
